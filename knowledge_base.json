Check physical connections:\n   - Both monitors connected and powered on\n   - Cables firmly connected (HDMI/DisplayPort/VGA)\n   - Try different cable if available\n\n2. Detect displays:\n   - Right-click desktop > Display settings\n   - Click \"Detect\" button\n   - Windows should find both monitors\n\n3. Configure display mode (Windows+P):\n   - PC screen only\n   - Duplicate (same on both)\n   - Extend (separate displays)\n   - Second screen only\n\n4. Arrange displays:\n   - Display settings > Identify\n   - Drag monitor icons to match physical layout\n   - Set which is primary display\n\n5. Match resolutions:\n   - Set appropriate resolution for each monitor\n   - Usually \"Recommended\" is best\n\n6. Check monitor input source:\n   - Use monitor buttons to select correct input\n   - HDMI 1, HDMI 2, DisplayPort, VGA, etc.\n\n7. Update graphics drivers:\n   - Device Manager > Display adapters\n   - Update all graphics drivers\n\n8. Check graphics card limitations:\n   - Verify GPU supports number of monitors\n   - Check if using correct ports\n\n9. Try one monitor at a time:\n   - Isolate which monitor/port has issue\n\n10. For docking stations:\n    - Update dock firmware\n    - Try connecting monitors directly to laptop\n\n**For alignment issues:**\n- Drag windows between screens to test\n- Adjust scale and layout per monitor\n- Set different wallpapers to identify screens\n\nContact IT if monitors not detected after all steps.",
